# Automatic speech recognition (ASR)

Automatic speech recognition is the task of automatically recognizing speech. You 
can find a repository tracking the state-of-the-art [here](https://github.com/syhw/wer_are_we).

{{ site.data.aaa.b }}

Works!

{% include table.html title="It is a title!" %}

Works as well (frankly, I am surprised!)

Will see if the thing below works as well:

{% for page in site.pages %}
 <p>{{ page.title }}</p>
{% endfor %}
